I am currently a postdoc working as a Research Fellow at Queen's University Belfast, on the core [Explaining Atheism](https://www.explainingatheism.org/) project.

I am interested in the Cognitive Science of Religion, or more specifically, the Cognitive Science of *non*-Religion. The Explaining Atheism is investigating the major psychological and social factors influencing non-belief (e.g. Cognitive Biases, Religious Socialisation). We are examining this across cultures, and in particular, look to use modern causal inference techniques to look at the causal pathways to non-belief.

Prior to joining the EA team, i completed my PhD in 2022. Based at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en) in Berlin, My PhD looked at cognitive biases how we learn and generalise different kinds of information.
